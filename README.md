# AINRP

**AI Identity and Non-Repudiation Protocol**

AINRP is a trust infrastructure layer for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It enables secure, verifiable, and accountable digital and physical actions by AI agents. This protocol uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs), smart contracts, and a native token (AINRP) to facilitate non-repudiation, permissioning, and governance across AI ecosystems.

---

## Vision
Build a zero-trust layer that ensures every AI agent:
- Has a cryptographically verifiable identity (W3C DID)
- Operates under permissioned smart contracts
- Logs its actions in an immutable, auditable trail
- Pays or earns via programmable stablecoins or AINRP tokens

---

## Architecture Overview
```
[Agent Action] 
→ [DID Auth] 
→ [AINRP Token Staked / Smart Contract Validation] 
→ [Blockchain Audit Log] 
→ [Stablecoin or Token Transaction]
```

### Smart Contract Modules
- **AINRPToken.sol** — ERC-20 token contract (1B supply)
- **DIDRegistry** — Agent identity binding and permission metadata *(in progress)*
- **Logger** — Immutable action log (linked to DID)
- **StakingManager** — Require token staking for agent rights *(optional)*
- **GovernanceDAO** — Proposals and voting for rule changes *(future)*

## AINRP Tokenomics (Draft)
| Category                     | Allocation |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| Community Development       | 35%        |
| Founders & Advisors         | 20%        |
| Validator / Auditor Rewards | 15%        |
| Treasury DAO                | 20%        |
| Ecosystem Partnerships      | 10%        |

AINRP is used for:
- Agent identity registration
- Logging fee microtransactions
- Voting on protocol upgrades
- Validator and compute node incentives

## Repository Structure (planned)
```
/contracts          # Solidity smart contracts
/scripts            # Deployment scripts (e.g., Hardhat)
/docs               # Protocol specs, architecture diagrams, whitepapers
/test               # Unit tests
/README.md          # This file
```
